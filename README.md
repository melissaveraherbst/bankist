# Bankist: A Fictional Online Bank

## Overview

Bankist is a virtual banking application developed as part of an online course by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is designed to showcase DOM manipulation and user interaction techniques. While it mimics the functionalities of an actual bank, please note that it does not possess a backend and lacks a genuine registration process.

## Functionalities

**Login:** Access your account securely.  
**Transfer Funds:** Send a value to another account within the system.  
**Request for Loans:** Apply for loans based on predefined parameters.  
**Close Account:** Delete your account from the system.

Please be aware that this project is purely frontend-based and serves as a learning exercise in client-side development.
