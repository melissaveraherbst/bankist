# Bankist &rarr; A Virtual Bank

</div>


Bankist is a simulated virtual bank application developed as part of an online course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. This project is purely frontend-based and serves as a learning exercise in client-side development, focusing on advanced DOM manipulation techniques.

Overview
The application consists of two main pages:

1. **Home Page (home.html):** A single-page layout with four sections, including a captivating hero section, a services and features section, and a user testimonial section.

2. **App Page (app.html):** This page is accessible after "logging in" through the home page and facilitates simple banking operations. Users can view balances, transfer money between other accounts, request loans, and review recent transactions.
